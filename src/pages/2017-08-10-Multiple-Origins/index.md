Is this post about me? The coffee blends I prefer? X-Men? All of the
above? Who knows what this will end up becoming, but the initial intent
is to trace the origins that seeded my recent acceleration in coffee
interest.

This is a long one, so grab a coffee, and try to create as much imagery
as you can in your mind as you read about my dark descent into light
roasts.

### Assam, India
#### Tea Gardens
Not my birthlace nor my parents', the tea gardens of Assam was the
origin from which my paternal grandparents grew up acquiring  the
cultural and social norms around tea that became a centerpiece in the
culture of hopsitality and entertaining guests at 68 Elephant Road.

### Dhaka, Bangladesh
#### 68 Elephant Road
I first visited Bangladesh when I was four, and have returned every
couple years since. Each morning, noon, afternoon, and evening, as I
played with my ambulance and firetruck, completed jigsaw puzzles, or
played computer games, I absorbed from the background the daily rituals
of watching the news, reading the newspaper, or just meditating in
silence in the mornings over a cup of tea, revitalizing for the
remainder of the day using a cup of strong tea after lunch, relaxing and
watching soaps on the tv over a cup of tea, catching up with eachother's
day at the dining table over tea. A key memory of 68 Elephant Road is
all the guests that would visit throughout the day, and every single
time with rare excpetion, a cart with "cha nasta", or tea and snack,
would be brought out for the guests, and each would be interrogated as
to how much sugar and milk they wanted.

While not at the same levels of caffeine and with not nearly as much
traffic, these notions of the role tea plays in meditation, utility, and
hospitatily made their way into the US through my parents and into our
household.

### Rapid City, South Dakota
#### Dawaats
The majority of my upbringing was in Rapid City, South Dakota.
"Dawaats", where the Bengali or broader Muslim community get together,
were an integral part of growing up in a mulitcultural environment.
There's a lot to delve into there, but the part that's relevant to the
topic at hand  is the offering of, without exception, tea or coffee at
every dawaat.  At larger community get-togethers in public spaces,
someone would always be responsible for making sure that either tea or
hot water was available for tea or coffee.  At Saudi homes, mint tea and
a particular coffee (pistachio or cardamom?) would be served. When at
our home, we offered Lipton Yellow Label tea with milk and sugar, and
Folger's instant coffee. I learned throughout all this that a hot
caffeinated beverage was a cultural expectation whenever at someone's
home, almost as much a usable bathroom: the absence of either upon
request would be somewhat awkward.

It was often my role growing up to go around asking the aunties and
uncles if they want tea or coffee, along with how much milk and sugar.
When younger, I used to pass on the orders to one of my parents, but as
I got older, I started making the tea and coffee, always paranoid that I
wasn't putting the right amount of milk or whether the tea back had been
steeped the right amount of time. Over time I got a feel for what the
"right" color was for black tea for varying strength, and what the
"right" color to attain the proper amount of milk.

### Cozumel, Mexico
yolo. Purchased Grinder. Was initially thinking of observing my
behaviour to see if I keep making coffee (using french press). Missed
Sunset. But then bought the espress machine. Knew I would buy it when I
was looking on Amazon at the Gran Belleza and couldn't find it in 120v,
and said out loud "I can't find the one I want :/", which meant I wanted
it, at which point I knew that the cheaper option was just that at that
point: the cheaper option. but give that it wasn't cheap either way,
might as well pay the premium for getting exactly what (I think) I want,
instead of potentially feeling unsatisfied and that I somehow
compromised.

### Oklahoma City, Oklahoma
