Is this post about me? The coffee I prefer? X-Men? All of the above? Who
knows, but the initial intent is to trace the origins that seeded my
recent acceleration in coffee interest.

This is a long one, so grab a coffee, and try to create as much imagery
as you can in your mind about how I decided to start fighting crime. By
drinking coffee..

### Assam, India
#### Tea Gardens
Tea, Bengali culture, Assam.
Ideas of the role of that "tea or coffee" plays socially and culturally.


### Rapid City, South Dakota
#### Dawaats
Coffee or Tea for guests.

#### By any means necessary
"Cha banai thebo?" around middle school and high school when I had a lot
of homework. An act of caring, with undertones of "finish your homework
by any means necessary"


#### Allergy Season
Benadryl, Instant Coffee, Waffles

#### The Cool Uncle
Starbucks
Albertsons

#### Debate
Starbbucks Frapacino
Deliberate sleep deprivation
First instance of late night for extrinsic responsiblities (not coding
or video games)


#### Caffeine Addiction

Culture
Coffee Shops, Hipsters, but no coffee
Social Ubiquity, friendly, date, work
Strawberry Shortcake Tea

### Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin

####Day Trips
Coding, emergence and awareness of Silcon Valley hoodie-wearing code
ninjas.

### NYC, New York
Getting through the work day. Cocaine comparison.
Self-proclaimed coffee snob rolling on, itch in my mind that "Hey, I'm
one too!"

### Sacremento, California
First pour over?

### Wilmington, Delaware
Caffeine is a drug. How did I not know? I usually resarch the
biochemistry of drugs.

### Pune, India
Cafe 108, Australians, Flat Whites, Ritual

coffee drink, espresso, etc.

### Portland, Oregon

resolve to buy espresso machine. Sparkling water. "Dial in"

### Cozumel, Mexico
yolo. Purchased Grinder. Was initially thinking of observing my
behaviour to see if I keep making coffee (using french press). Missed
Sunset. But then bought the espress machine. Knew I would buy it when I
was looking on Amazon at the Gran Belleza and couldn't find it in 120v,
and said out loud "I can't find the one I want :/", which meant I wanted
it, at which point I knew that the cheaper option was just that at that
point: the cheaper option. but give that it wasn't cheap either way,
might as well pay the premium for getting exactly what (I think) I want,
instead of potentially feeling unsatisfied and that I somehow
compromised.

### Oklahoma City, Oklahoma
More Yolo. All the Pour Overs. Barista who doesn't like coffee. Rosia:
